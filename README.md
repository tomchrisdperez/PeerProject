# PeerProject

## Notice : This is a revised version of PEERPROJECT, for transplanting it to VS2019 and fixing some file-encoding issues when compiling code.

PeerProject is a versatile peer-to-peer filesharing client and file manager. Intuitive and aesthetic while supporting many networks and features. BitTorrent, G2, Gnutella, eDonkey, DC++, IRC, http/ftp and more. Mainstream fork of Shareaza p2p, for Windows and WINE.
